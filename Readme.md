# James Need A Budget (WIP)

Personal budgeting tool through a cmdline interface.

This tool was original inspired by YNAB (https://www.youneedabudget.com/), but only in name. All code is written from scratch in python by oahzjh.

The reason for this tool is mainly to add multi-currency support. Most budgeting tools currently on the market does not fully support multi-currency, or if supported, there is no way to handle transactions cross account of different currency. In addition this tool is meant to be platform independent, hence implemented in python.

Currently the only interface method implemented is through cmdline.
